# stock-analysis
My macros used by a son wishing to analyze the best stocks for his parents to invest in for the years 2017 and 2018. I also wanted to refactor the code that I had used previously in order to improve the runtime.

## Results

### Stock performance


### Execution time improvement
The execution time from the original to refactored code improved from taking over 0.9 seconds to less than 0.2 seconds.

## Summary

### Advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code
There are a couple of main reasons to refactor code. These include improving the speed which the scripts will run, which may be of greater importance for larger blocks of code, as well as making the code more easily readable for anyone who needs to see the code.

### Refactoring for this script
For this particular set of analysis, there was no great need for refactoring in terms of execution time of the script. It took much longer to rewrite the code than would likely be saved by shortening the run speed. However it did also improve the readability and flow of the script itself.
